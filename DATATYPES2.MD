Data Types
Python has various built-in data types that allow us to store different kinds of values. Here’s a brief overview of the main data types:

int (Integer): Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal points. Example: x = 5, y = -42
float (Floating Point Number): Represents real numbers (numbers with a decimal point). Example: x = 3.14, y = -0.001
str (String): Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. Example: name = "Alice", greeting = 'Hello World'
bool (Boolean): Represents one of two values: True or False. Often used in conditional statements. Example: is_active = True, is_valid = False
list: A collection of ordered, mutable items (can store different data types). Lists are defined using square brackets []. Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tuple: A collection of ordered, immutable items (cannot be changed after creation). Tuples are defined using parentheses (). Example: coordinates = (10, 20), colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
set: A collection of unordered, unique items. Sets are mutable and defined using curly braces {}. Example: unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}, letters = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
dict (Dictionary): A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Dictionaries are mutable and defined using curly braces {} with keys and values separated by a colon(:). Example: student = {"name": "John", "age": 21}
None: Represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to indicate no value or a missing value. Example: result = None
