Foundational Concepts and Basic Programs



These programs focus on core syntax, variables, operators, and control flow (loops and conditional statements). 

Hello World! The classic first program to understand the print() function.

Add two numbers or find the maximum of two numbers.

Find the factorial or simple/compound interest of a number.

Check if a number is prime or an Armstrong number.

Print all Prime numbers within a given interval.

N-th Fibonacci number calculation.

Print ASCII Value of a character. 

Data Structures (Lists, Strings, etc.)

These examples introduce essential Python data structures and common operations. 

Lists/Arrays:

Sum of all elements in a list, finding the largest/smallest element.

Swapping the first and last elements in a list.

Removing duplicate elements or multiple elements from a list.

Finding the N largest elements from a list.

Strings:

Check if a string is a palindrome.

Reverse words in a given string.

Count the number of matching characters in a pair of strings. 

Searching, Sorting, and More Advanced Topics

For those ready for more challenging problems, GfG offers examples on algorithms and other concepts. 

Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc..

Searching Algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search (recursive and iterative).

File Handling: Reading from and writing to files.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
